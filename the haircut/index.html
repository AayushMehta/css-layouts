    were scribbled on a sheet of paper I carried in my pocket.

                I fantasized about resembling Japanese pianist Aimi Kobayashi, face wreathed in ear-length hair, cinnamon strands interweaved with caramel thread. I imagined transforming into the spitting image of Korean actress Seo Ji-Hye, side-parted ebony hair cascading down the spine, swaying like prairie grass in a gentle breeze.

                How thrilling it must be to strut my new hairdo in the asphalt runways of Manila, as the audience turn their heads, wondering who this woman could be. I might even hear a compliment or two.

            The sun hid behind a smoky blanket of clouds when I emerged from the salon like a fashion model. A faint smile stretched across my face as a breeze played with my shoulder-length hair, its top layers trimmed shorter than those beneath it. Head held by an invisible thread, shoulders kept slightly back, eyes gazing at the road ahead, I began my catwalk, placing one foot in front of the other in long strides. Skyscrapers stared at me from above, scrutinizing my every move. I didn’t mind; I even bade one of them a hello, but they never reciprocated. All I saw in the glass-coated surfaces was my reflection.
            I gaped at reality. My hairdo, though shorter, didn’t look any different from before

            “Ma’am, your appointment is next week, September 3,” said the receptionist.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shit. Nice one, Frances.
            <br><br>
            “The good news is we can still accommodate you today, but we’ll have to assign you a junior hair stylist,” added the receptionist.
            <br><br>
            “Okay, no problem,” I replied.

        <div class="box2">
    <p style="font-size: 28px;">
        My mom, who was with me, thought otherwise.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Are you sure you could trust a junior hair stylist?” She asked.
        <br><br>
        “If the hairdo ends up not to your liking, you might not step foot outside the house.”
        <br><br>
        “Whatever mom. It’s just hair. It’ll grow back.”

        Joan, my hair stylist, pulled out a hair color chart, selected three brown samples, and juxtaposed them beside my tresses.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Hair dye causes brain cancer. Plus, your hair will turn into a parched desert and years later, into ghastly white bristles,” my mother said as she hovered over us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “Here we go again,” I muttered to myself.

        Although I disagreed with my mom, she had a point — was looking beautiful at the expense of my health worth it? Being in the prime of my youth, I have so much to look forward to with my life, and lying on a hospital bed with an IV fluid injected into my veins was the least of it.
        <br>
        <br>
        “I’ll just get a haircut, thank you,” I told Joan.
        <br><br>
        And Joan scurried off to work her magic.
