    <div class="black-border">Six key phrases</div>
    were scribbled on a sheet of paper I carried in my pocket.

                I fantasized about resembling Japanese pianist Aimi Kobayashi, face wreathed in ear-length hair, cinnamon strands interweaved with caramel thread. I imagined transforming into the spitting image of Korean actress Seo Ji-Hye, side-parted ebony hair cascading down the spine, swaying like prairie grass in a gentle breeze.

                How thrilling it must be to strut my new hairdo in the asphalt runways of Manila, as the audience turn their heads, wondering who this woman could be. I might even hear a compliment or two.

            The sun hid behind a smoky blanket of clouds when I emerged from the salon like a fashion model. A faint smile stretched across my face as a breeze played with my shoulder-length hair, its top layers trimmed shorter than those beneath it. Head held by an invisible thread, shoulders kept slightly back, eyes gazing at the road ahead, I began my catwalk, placing one foot in front of the other in long strides. Skyscrapers stared at me from above, scrutinizing my every move. I didn’t mind; I even bade one of them a hello, but they never reciprocated. All I saw in the glass-coated surfaces was my reflection.
            I gaped at reality. My hairdo, though shorter, didn’t look any different from before
